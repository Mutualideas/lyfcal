# lyfcal: a calendar-like app displaying 

*Want to get a better understanding of the brevity of the human lifespan? How about an early start to your mid-life crisis? Perhaps you just need a reminder of time's fleeting nature to keep you on track.*

lyfcal: A calendar app that visually displays every day of your life, offering a unique perspective by allowing you to see your entire lifespan at a glance.

By inputting your birthdate and life expectancy, lyfcal calculates and displays every single day of your life in a visually intuitive format. Each day is represented as a box, allowing you to see at a glance how many days you've lived and how many you have left.
